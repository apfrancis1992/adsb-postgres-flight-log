# ADS-B Logger
Takes ADS-B data from a local receiver and copies it to a local postgres DB.

This python script pulls the data from the pi's TCP datastream on port 30003 and processes the data to be commited to a local Postgres database.

## PostgreSQL Preparation

SSH to your postgres instance to create a user and database for the program to use.
```bash
ssh username@IP
sudo apt-get install postgresql
psql -d postgres
```

```
CREATE USER username WITH PASSWORD 'password'; 
ALTER USER username WITH SUPERUSER;
CREATE DATABASE aircraft;
EXIT;
```


## Installation

Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/apfrancis1992/adsb-postgres-flight-log.git /opt/adsb-postgres-flight-log
```

Navigate to the root directory and create your configuration file.
```bash
nano /opt/adsb-postgres-flight-log/config.py
```

Enter the following credentials and info
```bash
username = "username" # Postgres DB Username
password = "password" # Postgres DB Password
lat = "xx.xxxx" # ADS-B latitude
lon = "-xx.xxxx" # ADS-B longitude
```

Install the python dependencies.
```bash
pip3 install -r /opt/adsb-postgres-flight-log/requirements.txt
```

Create a Systemd start file
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/adsb.service
```

Enter the following config info
```bash
[Unit]
Description=ADS-B Data Capture
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=username
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/adsb-postgres-flight-log/adsb.py

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Create a log file for the program
```bash
sudo touch /var/log/adsb.log
sudo chown username:username /var/log/adsb.log

1. Create tail number tracking to record certain tail numbers.
2. Create a web frontend to view the contents of the database on a map.
